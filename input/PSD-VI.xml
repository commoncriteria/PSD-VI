  <sec:Introduction>
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      The scope of this Protection Profile (PP)‐Module is to describe the security functionality of a specific type
      of Peripheral Sharing Device (PSD) product in terms of Common Criteria for Information Technology
      Security Evaluation, version 3.1, Release 5 [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for
      such products.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A Target of Evaluation (TOE) claiming conformance to this PP‐Module must also claim conformance to the
      Peripheral Sharing Device Protection Profile (PSD PP) as its Base‐PP. This is because the PSD PP is a generic
      Protection Profile aimed at defining baseline requirements and Evaluation Activities for a wide variety of
      PSD products, but additional specific requirements and Evaluation Activities apply depending on the types
      of physical and logical interfaces a PSD includes. Therefore, this PP‐Module defines additional Security
      Functional Requirements (SFRs) for security functionality unique to a PSD that includes the ability to
      manipulate or assign video source inputs to video or display output devices.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      A compliant Target of Evaluation (TOE) for this PP‐Module is any PSD that supports connectivity for one or
      more video output peripheral devices. All of the requirements and restrictions that the PSD PP defines
      apply to a conformant TOE. A conformant TOE satisfies all of the specific data protection/isolation
      capabilities that the PSD PP requires. A conformant TOE embodies one or more of the use cases defined
      in the PSD PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A candidate TOE for claiming conformance to this PP‐Module is any TOE that conforms to the PSD PP and
      includes video and display functionality as connected peripherals. In particular, a conformant TOE should
      support one or more video sources and one or more video display devices.<h:br/><h:br/>
      The TOE may include functionality for additional types of computer interfaces (e.g. keyboard/mouse, user
      authentication device). When this is the case, the TOE will claim conformance to all applicable PP‐Modules
      that extend the PSD PP.
    </section>      
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The TOE boundary is a PSD. Refer to the PSD PP for an outline of the TOE boundary. When claiming
        conformance to this PP‐Module, the TOE boundary will include one or more each of peripheral and
        computer interfaces that can be used to transmit video signals. It is permissible to use this PP‐Module in
        conjunction with other PP‐Modules that also extend the PSD PP by claiming conformance to a
        PP-Configuration
        that includes all applicable PP‐Modules. In this manner, a single TOE may support multiple
        different types of peripherals.<h:br/><h:br/>
        A conformant TOE may simultaneously present the video output of one or more computers per peripheral
        port; it is not required to be a one‐to‐one relationship. Section 1.4 below defines specific methods of
        supported video display.
      </section>      
    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
      This PP‐Module does not define additional use cases beyond what the PSD PP defines. The TOE should
      embody one or more use cases from the PSD PP. This PP‐Module’s functionality defines
      implementation-independent
      functionality (i.e., not tied to any specific use cases) and relates entirely to the specific
      security requirements related to security of the physical and logical interfaces for assigning video and
      display devices. Specifically, the TOE may perform any of the following functions:<h:ul>
        <h:li>Display PSD – Output from one or more connected computers to be presented on a single display</h:li>
        <h:li>Keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) PSD – Output from one or more connected computers to be
      presented on one or more displays along with keyboard and mouse user interaction—in this case,
      the TOE boundary would also include the requirements of the PP‐Module for Keyboard/Mouse
      (KM) Input Devices</h:li>
        <h:li>Combiner/Multi‐viewer – Output from multiple computers to be shown simultaneously on one or
      more displays along with keyboard and mouse user interaction</h:li>
        <h:li>Video Wall – Output from one or more computers to be shown across multiple displays</h:li>
    </h:ul>
    </section>    
    <section title="Test Environment for Evaluation Activities">
      In order to ensure that the TOE demonstrates the functionality required by the EAs, it is necessary for
      the evaluator to ensure that they have appropriate equipment to conduct the required testing. In
      addition to the equipment that is relevant for testing any PSD as defined in the PSD PP, the following
      additional equipment should be used in testing:<h:ul>
        <h:li>Display devices encompassing all display protocols the TOE supports (Video Graphics Array (VGA),
          High‐Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), Digital Visual Interface (DVI)‐I/D, DisplayPort, and
          USB Type‐C with DisplayPort as alternate function)</h:li>
        <h:li>Oscilloscope capable of sampling at least one single‐ended signal or one differential signal at 400
          MHz or above</h:li>
        <h:li>3.3v power supply</h:li>
        <h:li>100 Ohm resistor</h:li>
        <h:li>Multi‐meter capable of measuring voltage in millivolts and resistance above 2 Mega‐Ohms</h:li>
        <h:li>Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) Control Console Software</h:li>
        <h:li>I2C Programmer</h:li>
        <h:li>Conditional – If the TOE supports DisplayPort video interfaces:<h:ul>
          <h:li>DisplayPort AUX Channel Analyzer</h:li>
          <h:li>DisplayPort Source generator device or Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) card</h:li>
        </h:ul></h:li>
        <h:li>Conditional – If the TOE supports HDMI or DVI video interfaces:<h:ul>
          <h:li>HDMI sink test device</h:li>
          <h:li>HDMI source generator or PCI card</h:li>
        </h:ul></h:li>        
        <h:li>Conditional – If the TOE supports VGA video interfaces:<h:ul>
          <h:li>VGA sink test device</h:li>
          <h:li>VGA source generator or PCI card</h:li>
        </h:ul></h:li>        
        <h:li>Conditional – If the TOE supports USB‐Type C with DisplayPort as alternate function video
          interfaces<h:ul>
            <h:li>USB sniffer</h:li>
            <h:li>UB source generator or PCI card</h:li>
          </h:ul></h:li>        
        <h:li>Optional: Spectrum analyzer with single‐ended and differential probes. Spectrum analyzer
          bandwidth should be at least 20% higher than the highest video bandwidth the TOE supports</h:li>
        <h:li>Optional: Video breakout device compatible with TOE display interfaces</h:li>            
      </h:ul>      
      When conducting testing, each TOE interface must be tested but not all interfaces must be tested
      simultaneously. For example, if testing a 16‐port device, the evaluator may use four connected computers,
      but must change the connected ports several times to ensure all TOE display interfaces and all TOE
      computer video interfaces are tested. Some equivalency arguments between ports are allowed.

                This SFR is refined from the PSD PP for this PP‐Module to include further
                restrictions for electrical signals. It is unlikely that this element can be satisfied
                unless video/display peripheral device interfaces are electrically and logically
                isolated from the connected computer interfaces or through other methods.<h:br/><h:br/>
                If the TOE claims conformance to multiple PP‐Modules, each PP‐Module modifies
                this SFR in a different manner for the interfaces that are unique to that module. In
                this case, the ST author should reference this modification of the SFR as
                “FDP_APC_EXT.1/VI” for uniqueness. Note that all elements of FDP_APC_EXT.1
                must be included in this iteration, not just the ones that are modified by this PP-Module.

              This PP‐Module adds a new display mechanism that is unique to video/display
              peripherals and a new trigger for when the SFR applies. Neither of these
              changes conflict with the original SFR definition in the PSD PP.
            </consistency-rationale>
            <description>This SFR is selection‐based in the PSD PP depending on whether the TOE has a switching capability (i.e., if the TOE is an isolator and only has one connected computer, no indication of the active computer is necessary). It remains selection‐based when
              the TOE conforms to this PP-Module. When the TOE is a Combiner (i.e., it may display a combination of multiple video feeds on a single monitor), it is required to have a visual indicator of each source computer on the active video feeds. This is also required if the TOE implements a function where a monitor may display a selectable video feed that is separate from the computer that is active for other peripherals; for example, a 4-port TOE may support keyboard, mouse, and monitor peripherals that are selectable to any of the connected computers, while an independent monitor may have an active video feed from one or more computers that is set independently of the active peripherals. In this case, the primary active computer may be indicated by a light or other indication on the chassis, while the "video feed" monitor is required to have a label in the feed itself so that there are no ambiguous or conflicting indicators. A refinement has been added to FTA_CIN_EXT.1.2 to define the on-screen display behavior expected when the Combiner use case applies.
